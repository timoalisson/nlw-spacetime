          And disciplinary remains mercifully Yes and um, I'm with you Derek,<br />
          this star nonsense Yes, yes Now which is it? I am sure of it So, so<br />
          you think you can tell Heaven from hell? Blue skies from pain? Can
          you<br />
          tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do
          you<br />
          think you can tell? Did they get you to trade Your heroes for
          ghosts?<br />
          Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for<br />
          change? Did you exchange A walk-on part in the war For a leading
          role<br />
          in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost<br />
          souls Swimming in a fish bowl Year after year Running over the same<br />
          old ground What have we found? The same old fears Wish you were
          here<br />
